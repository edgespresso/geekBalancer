======================
GEEK BALANCER:

- DISCORD bot command (!balance_players) to gather users currently in the Discord GeekFest Lounge
- Send those names to the STATS server via a new API
- STATS server will parse the Discord names, matching to PLAYER NAME and STEAM ID stored on STATS server
- Need a mapping table on STATS server (Discord name, Steam Name, Steam ID)
- Send parsed list of STEAM IDs to the GEEK BALANCER python code running on the STATS server
- GEEK BALANCER will create the top 5 permutations for teams, within a specified threshold
- GEEK BALANCER will send the 5 team options to DISCORD
- The 5 team options will be displayed in a new DISCORD channel (Captains), with some sort of voting options
- The 2 team captains will then vote on the permutations
- Once a permutation is selected, then the DISCORD bot will move the players to the appropriate TEAM A and TEAM B channels
- The Captain and Co-Captains can bet auto set in the STATS server

Additionally:
- DISCORD bot command (!team_a_CT or !team_a_T) that sends the list of users in TEAM A and TEAM B to the STATS server (API? in the LOG?)
- The STATS server will then move the players to the appropriate CSGO team - CT or T 
    - If command was !team_a_CT, then the users in TEAM A are moved to CT and TEAM B moved to T
    - If command was !team_a_T, then the users in TEAM A are moved to T and TEAM B moved to CT

======================
GEEK GUN GUARD:

For Phase 2, add weapon restrictions based on TIER

SOURCEMOD PLUGIN that enables GeekFest Tier restrictions
When enabled, upon player spawn, will send the player name and steam IDs to the STATS server via LOG MESSAGE
The STATS server will have 4 files pre-configured (tier_master.cfg, tier_gold,cfg, etc)
Each TIER CFG file will have a list of weapon names (ie, awp) that are restricted for that tier
When the STATS server receives the player name/steamID, it will determine the players current tier
Then it will restrict the player based on the CFG file (ie, ggg_restrict STEAM_1:1:123456 awp)
The user will be able to buy the awp, in this instance, but it will be immediately dropped and that player wont be able to pick it up
